Java Sorting Program README
===========================

Author: Sofia
File: Sort.java
Description: This program reads floating-point numbers from an input file, 
sorts them using both Merge Sort and Quick Sort, and writes the sorted output 
to a file. It also prints the execution time for both sorting algorithms 
(excluding file I/O time).

===================
Required Files
===================
- Sort.java         → Main program containing Merge Sort and Quick Sort
- input.txt         → ASCII text file containing unsorted float-point numbers (space-separated)
- output.txt        → Will be generated to contain sorted numbers (from Merge Sort)

===================
How to Compile
===================

1. Open a terminal (or command prompt) in the folder where Sort.java is saved.

2. Run the following command to compile the Java program:

   javac Sort.java

   This will create a file named Sort.class in the same directory.

===================
How to Run
===================

After compiling, run the program using:

   java Sort

===================
Input Format
===================
- The file `input.txt` should be placed in the same directory.
- It should contain float-point numbers separated by spaces on a single line.
  Example:
  3.14 2.71 0.577 1.618 42.0 9.81 7.77 5.55 6.66 10.01 0.001 -2.5 8.8

===================
Output Format
===================
- The program creates an `output.txt` file containing the sorted numbers from Merge Sort.
- The execution times (in milliseconds) for both Merge Sort and Quick Sort are printed to the console.

===================
Note
===================
- Both sorting algorithms preserve float precision.
- You may switch between Merge Sort and Quick Sort output by modifying the writer loop in the main method.
